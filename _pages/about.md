I'm a Software Developer that prides myself on cultural contributions in onboarding, mentoring, and team building. My love of videogames led me to study programming and wanting a bit of everything, I started my career developing simulations for mining vehicles before moving to Europe and developing backend services. I have led small teams of software developers and been involved in improving all aspects of the software development lifecycle. Outside of work I spend my time playing the drums, amateur photography and of course enjoying videogames and boardgames.
